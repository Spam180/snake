### Snake Game

### Setting up

We're using a library called Slick.  To setup you need to
follow these instructions if you're using Eclipse:

1. First download this source code and create a new project in
Eclipse.  You can either point it directly to the source code files
or use the Eclipse setup process and then copy the src/ and img/
folders into the location where Eclipse makes the project.

2. Download the libraries here:
- LWJGL: http://www.lwjgl.org/download.php
- Slick download link at the top of this page http://slick.ninjacave.com/wiki/index.php?title=Setting_up_Slick2D_with_NetBeansIDE

3. You then need to follow these instructions to get the libraries
into the project environment:
http://lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Setting_Up_LWJGL_with_Eclipse

Make sure you link to lwlgl.jar, slick.jar and jinput.jar, and
follow the instructions for pointing to the native lwlgl code.

4. Open SnakeMain.java in Eclipse and run it.

Some more help on this blog page if you want to also link to
the javadoc so that Eclipse gives you nice code hints for the
slick library: http://baksteenbrick.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/writing-java-games-with-slick-part-one-setting-up-an-eclipse-project/
